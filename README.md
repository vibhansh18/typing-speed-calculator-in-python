# Typing-Speed-Calculator
**Typing speed calculator** - A python program which can calculate the approx typing speed of a user in words per minute(WPM) and also tracks the number of mistakes done by the user while giving this test. 

Find the *typing_speed_phrases.txt* to pick the phrases randomly. You need to place this file in the same folder as of the program or provide the full path of those files in the code.

The typing speed test history is also stored in a text file.
